This project is made for my best friend, who shall colloquially be dubbed as Jsan here.

The project is built with Next.js, deployed on Vercel, and utilizes the following main tools:
- Tailwind CSS
- AuthJS
- PostgresQL
- Redis

As of right now, the backend is not deployed due to the price of deploying generative NLP models.
However, this is subject to change.
